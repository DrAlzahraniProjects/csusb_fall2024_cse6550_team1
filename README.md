## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the application locally using Docker.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Installation Guide

### Building and Running from Source Code

1. **Clone the repository**

   Clone the repository from the main branch:

   ```bash
   git clone -b main --single-branch https://github.com/DrAlzahraniProjects/csusb_fall2024_cse6550_team1.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**

   Change your directory to the repository folder:

   ```bash
   cd csusb_fall2024_cse6550_team1
   ```

3. **Update the local repository**

   Ensure your local repository is up to date by running:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
   
4. **Build the Docker image**

   Build the Docker image using the following command:

   *DO NOT RUN THIS COMMAND YET, THE API KEY IN STEP 5 MUST BE INCLUDED AT THE END OF THE COMMAND*

   ```bash
   docker build -t team1_app:latest . --build-arg MISTRAL=
   ```

5. **Include the API key**

   - Go to [Team1 QA](https://csusb.instructure.com/courses/43192/discussion_topics/419701) and copy the MISTRAL API key
   - Paste the API key at the end of the previous instruction
   - Your command should look like this:
   ```bash
   docker build -t team1_app:latest . --build-arg MISTRAL=APIKEYHERE
   ```
   - Run the command

6. **Run the Docker container**

   Run the Docker container with the following command:

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5001:5001 -p 6001:6001 team1_app
   ```
